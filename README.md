Part 0:

Unresolved Issues : Numeric values were not right aligned by default and I could not get the right/left manipulators to shift 
the code. Therefore I used setw() with a value of 9 to align those values as well.

could not figure out how to display commas.


Part 1:

Both the Scientific member function or manipulator did not work without this namespace. 
Goal was to write code using std::cout and cout.setf(ios::scientific) but with namespace this seems redundant.  


Notes: None
